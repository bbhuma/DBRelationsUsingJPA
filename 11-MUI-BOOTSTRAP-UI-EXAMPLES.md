# 11. Material-UI and Bootstrap UI Examples

## What Was Added

- `MuiStudentForm.js`: Student registration form using Material-UI components
- `BootstrapStudentForm.js`: Student registration form using React-Bootstrap components
- `MuiDashboard.js`: Example Material-UI dashboard with a Chart.js class performance chart

## How to Use

- Import and use `MuiStudentForm` or `BootstrapStudentForm` in your pages/components as needed
- Use `MuiDashboard` for a modern, responsive dashboard with analytics
- Both forms and dashboards are mobile-friendly and visually distinct

## Chart.js vs. Alternatives

- **Chart.js** (with `react-chartjs-2`) is widely used, flexible, and integrates well with React
- Good for bar, line, pie, and mixed charts
- Alternatives: Recharts, Victory, Nivo, ApexCharts (Chart.js is a solid default for most school analytics needs)
