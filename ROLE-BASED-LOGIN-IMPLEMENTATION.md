# Role-Based Login and Dashboard Separation: Implementation Notes

This document explains how role-based login and dashboard separation (admin, teacher, student, parent) was implemented in the React frontend.

---

## 1. Login Page with Role Selection

- Created `Login.js` component in `frontend/src/components/`.
- The login form allows the user to select a role (admin, teacher, student, parent), enter username and password.
- On submit, the selected role and username are passed to the main app (no real authentication yet, but ready for backend integration).

## 2. Role-Based Dashboard Components

- Created one dashboard component for each role:
  - `AdminDashboard.js`
  - `TeacherDashboard.js`
  - `StudentDashboard.js`
  - `ParentDashboard.js`
- Each dashboard displays a welcome message and a placeholder for role-specific data and controls.

## 3. App Routing and State Management

- Updated `App.js`:
  - Maintains a `user` state (null if not logged in).
  - If not logged in, shows the `Login` component.
  - After login, shows the dashboard for the selected role.
  - Navigation bar includes a logout button to reset the user state.
  - Uses React Router for navigation between dashboard, students, teachers, and classes.

## 4. How to Expand

- Integrate real authentication (API call in `Login.js`).
- Fetch and display real data in each dashboard based on the logged-in user and role.
- Add role-based access control to routes and UI actions.
- Customize each dashboard for the needs of admins, teachers, students, and parents.

## 5. Summary

- The frontend now supports clean separation of user roles at login.
- Each role sees only their relevant dashboard and data.
- The structure is ready for real authentication and further expansion.

**This approach provides a scalable foundation for a real-world school management system UI.**
