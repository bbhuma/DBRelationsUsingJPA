# Integrating Third-Party Authentication (OAuth2, SSO, Social Login)

## Overview

This document explains how third-party authentication (such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or enterprise SSO) can be integrated into your Spring Boot/JWT-based system. No code changes are made by this documentâ€”this is for architecture, planning, and onboarding.

## 1. What is Third-Party Authentication?

- Allows users to log in using external identity providers (IdPs) like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Okta, Azure AD, etc.
- Uses protocols such as OAuth2, OpenID Connect (OIDC), or SAML.
- Reduces password fatigue and improves security (no password stored in your DB for these users).

---

## 2. Typical Flow (OAuth2/OIDC)

1. **User clicks "Login with Google" (or other provider) on your app.**
2. **User is redirected to the provider's login page.**
3. **User authenticates with the provider.**
4. **Provider redirects back to your app with an authorization code.**
5. **Your backend exchanges the code for an access token and ID token.**
6. **Your backend verifies the ID token, extracts user info (email, name, etc.), and creates or updates a local user record.**
7. **Your backend generates a local JWT for the user and returns it to the client.**
8. **Client uses your JWT for all subsequent API calls (as with normal login).**

## 3. How It Works With Your System

- Third-party login is handled by Spring Security's OAuth2 client support.
- After successful third-party login, you map the external user to a local `User` entity and assign roles as needed.
- You issue your own JWT for stateless API access, just like with local users.
- You can mix local and third-party users in the same system.

## 4. Example Providers

- **Google**: OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- **Microsoft/Azure AD**: OIDC or SAML
- **Facebook**: OAuth2
- **Okta, Auth0, OneLogin**: OIDC/SAML (enterprise SSO)

---

## 5. Security and Best Practices

- Always validate the ID token signature and claims.
- Map external users to local users by email or provider ID.
- Assign roles based on external group membership or local admin rules.
- Use HTTPS for all redirects and token exchanges.
- Optionally, allow users to link multiple providers to one local account.

## 7. Example Architecture Diagram

```
[User] --(browser)--> [Your App] --(redirect)--> [Google/Microsoft/SSO]
   <--(token)--        <--(redirect)--
[Your App] verifies token, creates/updates user, issues local JWT
[User] uses local JWT for all API calls
```

## 8. When to Use

- Enterprise SSO (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
- Social login (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Reducing password management burden
- Enabling multi-factor authentication via provider

---

## 9. Limitations

- You must trust the external provider for user identity.
- Role mapping and user provisioning logic must be carefully designed.
- Logout and token revocation may require additional handling.
